This app was created for a technical challenge. The task was to have a Rails JSON API with Angular front-end, and this was something I have not done previously.

This version was done by implementing a separate apps for the back- and front-end, which was a lot more efficient, since my time was spent learning Angular rather than finding workarounds for Webpacker.

The project was done in a week, and the it allows the user to view the contents of the database, add/update/remove rows of data, and to view features of individual database entries. It also has Chart.js integrated, however I ran out of time, so the graphs were not implemented.
